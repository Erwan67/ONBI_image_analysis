<h1>Colocalisation practical 1</h1>

<p>The goal of this practical is for students to examine some of the practical considerations when performing colocalisation.</p>

<p>Before getting started please make sure you do the following:<br />
- Open Fiji by typing &#39;Fiji&#39; into the terminal of the linux workstation. You can find the Terminal by searching for it or by the short-cut: &#39;Ctrl + Alt + T&#39;<br />
- Make sure you have cloned the repository with the image files. (e.g. using the terminal, navigate to a folder you can easily find, and then type: git clone https://github.com/dwaithe/ONBI_image_analysis. This will download the image files and exercises to a local folder). If you need to update the content of this folder please use 'git fetch'.<br>
- If you see any typos or want to recommend any improvements please paste the error or write the idea to: <a href="mailto:dominic.waithe@imm.ox.ac.uk?Subject=Suggestion/Found an error.">dominic.waithe@imm.ox.ac.uk</a>
<h3>Colocalisation A</h3>

<p>4a) Open the image Healthy.lsm. Examine the image. You should notice that there are two channels. We want to establish the colocalisation between the two channels using the Pearson&#39;s correlation coefficient. To do this you will first have to split the channels: -&gt;Image-&gt;Color-&gt;Split Channels.</p>

<p>Note(Green channel is filipin III (binds cholesterol) magenta is Lysotracker (as name implies stains lysosomes). Niemann Pick C is a disease where cholesterol trafficking to plasma membrane is impaired and it accumulates in lysosomes).</p>

<p class="todo">Question) Inspect the images. From what you have learnt from the lecture on colocalisation what do you think makes this image less than ideal for Pearson&#39;s colocalisation analysis? Tip (try using the Hi-Lo look-up-table).</p>

<p>4b) Goto Analyze-&gt;Colocalisation-&gt; Coloc 2 function. Add the two channels that you have just split, one from either channel, leave the &#39;ROI mask&#39; unselected for now. Run the colocalisation with all the parameters unchecked. Look for the output marked Pearson&#39;s R value (no threshold). What value do you get? Repeat this for the other image called Sick.lsm.</p>

<p class="todo">Question) How do the R- values differ for these two images? Do you think you could use this result as a basis for distinguishing the visual phenotype of the two images?</p>

<h3>Colocalisation B</h3>

<p>4c) Open the image neuron.tif. We only want to work with the first and last channel. One way to separate them from the original image is to use image-&gt;Duplicate. Check the box marked &#39;Duplicate HyperStack&#39; but type &#39;1&#39; in the channels box rather than having &#39;1-4&#39;. Click &#39;ok&#39;. Repeat, but duplicate channel 4 instead. You should now have two images (one for each channel).</p>

<p>4d) Goto Analyze-&gt;Colocalisation-&gt; Coloc 2 function. Click the first two slices that you created, one from either channel, leave the &#39;ROI mask&#39; unselected for now. Run the colocalisation with all the parameters checked. Look for the output marked Pearson&#39;s R-value (no threshold).</p>

<p class="todo">Question) What value do you get?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4e) This time repeat the exercise but with an oval selection surrounding only the fluorescent region of the cell with no minimal background. Next goto Edit-&gt;Selection- &gt;Create Mask. In the &#39;Coloc 2&#39; dialog box you will have to select under &#39;mask or ROI&#39; the newly created mask image entitled &#39;Mask&#39;. Run the &#39;Coloc 2&#39; plugin.</p>

<p class="todo">Question) What is the Pearson&#39;s R-value now?</p>

<p class="todo">What is the effect of removing the background pixels on the R-value of the test and control condition? Why do you think this is the case.</p>

<p>4f) Repeat the previous step but this time create a mask from one of the channels. To do this we are going to threshold the cyan channel. First, duplicate the cyan channel using Image-&gt;Duplicate. Then bring up the Image-&gt;Adjust-&gt;Threshold and click &#39;set&#39;. Type in &#39;5-255&#39;. This will create a binary image with pixels becoming either &#39;0&#39; or &#39;255&#39; based on whether there original intensity was above or below the value &#39;5&#39;. In the &#39;Coloc 2&#39; dialog box you will have to select under &#39;mask or ROI&#39; the newly created mask image entitled &#39;Mask&#39;. You may have to invert the threshold mask for it to work correctly Image-&gt;Invert. To establish what areas are being included in the colocalisation analysis make sure the &#39;Display Images in Results&#39; checkbox is positive. When you run the plugin you can view the included pixels by selecting either &#39;Channel 1&#39; or Channel 2&#39; from the drop-down box at the top of the output dialog.</p>

<p class="todo">Question) Does the colocalisation R-value change if you change the mask? What is the reason for this?</p>
